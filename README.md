# DNA Transcription and Translation Tester

A program that generates random DNA and mRNA sequences to test transcription and translation. To use, after downloading the code natively, run ```DNA.c``` and follow the instructions in the terminal.

Translation from mRNA to amino acids is currently not implemented.

Made in C because I needed the practice.
